          High Stone Games is a small independent Italian studio. Their
          preferred gameplay style is 2D with cartoon graphics, fast-paced
          gameplay, and is primarily developed in Unity.<br />
          With them, I developed Star Bugs, a universe full of fascinating
          creatures born of the desire to create a new and fun way to interact
          with collectible NFTs.<br />
          The gameplay, based on idle mechanics and turn-based card games,
          allows the user to breed, collect and fight their insects in a real
          internal ecosystem.<br />

          A club for passionate developers which I took part for some years
          enabling me to learn how coordinate people interacting among different
          teams. The team was divided into coders, 3d artists and illustrators
          with the aim to develop video-game software and to acquire know-how.
          Every year a 48H event was planned in order to create a full
          video-game with simple graphic mechanics in 48 hours. At the beginning
          the projects were made in C++ with opengl libs and then in XNA
          framework. Finally the association switched to Unity3d engine and
          wysiwyg tools.

          I developed a Java 3D project called “interior design software” where
          it is possible to plan any room of the house. The user can also add
