  <section class="about-text">
    <p>
      I've been playing with the idea of becoming a game developer probably
      since I was a child and my father bought a Commodor64 spending time to
      copy and compile code from magazines of the time.
    </p>

    <p>
      After doing my <b>Computer Science degree</b> at University of Perugia I
      found that getting into the game industry was far more difficult that I
      had originally imagined, especially in Italy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using tools like Microsoft XNA, <b>Unity</b> or <b>Unreal Engine</b> it
      became simpler and over the years I realized many personal project having
      the aim to strengthen my skills.

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px">My professional journey</h3>

    <p>
      I moved to Ireland and I lived in <b>Dublin</b> for two years to improve
      my english but without the opportunity to enter in the professional world
      of videogames.
    </p>

    <p>
      The opportunity came where I would never expect it... in Italy.<br />
      I worked for 3 years in <b>WhatWapp</b>, one of the most important mobile
      video game companies in Italy, where I was part of several projects and
      where I learned a lot on a professional level.
    </p>

    <p>
      After the lockdown, I sought a work environment that would allow me to
      better balance my personal and professional life: this was <b>Gamindo</b
      ><br />
      Working fully remotely gave me the flexibility to reconnect with friends
      and loved ones. <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      Now I feel the need to engage with more structured organizations and to
      work on products with greater complexity and quality.
