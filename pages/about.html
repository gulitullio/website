  <section class="about-text">
    <p>
      I've been playing with the idea of becoming a game developer probably
      since I was a child and my father bought a Commodor64 spending time to
      copy and compile code from magazines of the time.
    </p>

    <p>
      After doing my Computer Science degree at University of Perugia I found
      that getting into the game industry was far more difficult that I had
      originally imagined, especially in Italy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using tools like Microsoft XNA, Unity or Unreal Engine it became simpler
      and over the years I realized many personal project having the aim to
      strengthen my skills.
    </p>

    <p>
      I moved to Ireland and I lived in Dublin for two years to improve my
      english but without the opportunity to enter in the professional world of
      videogames.
    </p>

    <p>
      The opportunity came where I would never expect it... in Italy.<br />
      I worked for 3 years in WhatWapp, one of the most important mobile video
      game companies in Italy, where I was part of several projects and where I
      learned a lot on a professional level.
    </p>

    <p>And here we are, trying something new to help me grow further.</p>

            the house. The user can also add additional furniture to the plan
            and in real time the software renders the room with the added
            components.
