    Skat is the most popular card game in Germany that requires strategic and
    deductive skills.<br /><br />

    The game has several divisions, depending on the skill of the player, which
    will unlock different tables with increasing prizes.<br /><br />

    There are also several mini-games such as the wheel of fortune or the food
    palace where you can complete restaurant orders.<br /><br />
