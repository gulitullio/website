    Car workshop simulator game. Each month is a stage where customers arrived
    with requests to satisfy in terms of power, safety, fuel consumption.<br /><br />

    The goal is to be as accurate as possible in satisfying the request by
    trying to spend as little as possible. With the money obtained it is
    possible to unlock new components for increasingly demanding or extreme
    requests.
