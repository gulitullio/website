    An idea developed during the Summer UE4jam with the theme "Blessing in
    disguise", first official use of Unreal Engine.<br /><br />

    The idea was a game where you had to save pedestrians from objects thrown
    from the windows. The player could intervene for example by throwing banana
    peels and saving the victim.
