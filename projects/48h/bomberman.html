    Made with the amateur team Wakefullness in its first internal edition of the
    48h.<br /><br />

    It is a 3D Bomberman reinterpreted with new mechanics.<br /><br />

    Both players compete on the same keyboard on 5 possible scenarios and they
    can earn points by finding hidden resources behind the destructible blocks
    and take points away from the opponent by killing him. In addition, it is
    possible to find upgrades to place more bombs or increase their range.
