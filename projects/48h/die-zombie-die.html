    Tower defense made in 48h with the PsychoGames team using the Eagle Engine,
    a custom game engine created by the founder.<br /><br />

    It is a tower defence taking place in a post-apocalyptic world.<br /><br />

    The goal is to prevent enemies from crossing the map by building towers of
    various kinds but with the addition that the map is obscured and you need
    turrets that light the map to know where the enemies are.
