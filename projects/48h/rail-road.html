    Race simulator made with the Wakefullness amateur team for the second
    internal edition of the 48h.<br /><br />

    Everyone in their childhood has played and loved slot cars. The game
    replicate the bedroom of a child intent on building his own track of slot
    cars.<br /><br />

    The game consists in two main sections:<br /><br />

    - a track editor where you can attach the pieces composed by straight, tight
    and wide curves<br />
    - a race phase where it is only possible to throttle up and down to the
    finish
